# Drawing-with-Python
Drawing a landscape using the Draw 2D library Python
During the previous lesson's milestone, I wrote code to draw at least the sky, clouds, and ground of an outdoor scene. During this lesson, I will write code that draws the remaining objects in your scene. Your program can draw any outdoor scene that you like as long as it meets these requirements:

The scene must be outdoor and include part of the sky.
The sky must have clouds.
The scene must include repetitive objects, such as blades of grass, trees, leaves on a tree, birds, flowers, insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed lines on a road, buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or icicles.
My program must be divided into functions such as draw_sky, draw_cloud, draw_ground, draw_bird, draw_flower, draw_insect, draw_fish, or draw_snowman. Each repetitive object in your scene should be drawn by a function that your program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated object. For example, your program could include a function named draw_leaf that your program repeatedly calls to draw each leaf on a tree at a different location.
